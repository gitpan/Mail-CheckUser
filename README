SHORT DESCRIPTION

This Perl module provides routines for checking validness of email address.

It makes several checks:

1) it checks syntax of email address;

2) it checks if there any MX record or at least A record for domain
in email address;

3) it tries to connect to email server directly via SMTP to check if
mailbox is valid. Old versions of this module have performed this
check via VRFY command. Now module uses another check: it uses
combination of commands MAIL and RCPT which simulates fake sending of
email. It can detect bas mailboxes in many cases. For example
hotmail.com mailboxes can be verified with MAIL/RCPT check.

This module was designed with CGIs in mind. It has support for check
timeout so it can be used to filter fast wrong e-mail adresses in CGI
forms (passing as valid e-mail addresses that can't be checked
fastly).

For details see pod documentation in Mail::CheckUser

REQUIREMENTS

This module requires next Perl modules:

1) Net::SMTP (libnet package)
2) Net::DNS  (Net-DNS package)
3) IO::Handle (IO package)

Perl distributions before 5.6 contain version of IO::Handle which has bugs
in timeouts handling. Download latest version from CPAN if you haven't did
it before.

INSTALLATION

perl Makefile.PL
make

Tests can run very slowly especially if you have network down.
