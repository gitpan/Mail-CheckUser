SHORT DESCRIPTION

This Perl module provides routines for checking validness of email address.

It makes several checks:

1) it checks syntax of email address;

2) it checks if there any MX record for specified in email domain or if
there exist such host;

3) it tries to connect to email server directly via SMTP to check with
command VRFY if user is valid.

This module was designed with CGIs in mind. It has support for check timeout
so it can be used to filter faslty wrong e-mail adresses in CGI forms
(passing as valid e-mail addresses that can't be checked fastly).

For details see pod documentation in Mail::CheckUser

REQUIREMENTS

This module requires next Perl modules:

1) Net::SMTP (libnet package)
2) Net::DNS  (Net-DNS package)

Perl distributions before 5.6 contain version of IO::Handle which has bugs
in timeouts handling. Download latest version from CPAN if you haven't did
it before.
