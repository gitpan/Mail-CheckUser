Revision history for Perl module Mail::CheckUser

0.90  Thu Nov 16 16:31:10 2000
	- Removed some tests because some my test mailboxs have became
	  invalid
	- Some minor pod doc fixes
	- Marking this release as 0.90 since I belive it has reached stable
	  state now

0.17  Mon Sep 25 21:06:06 2000
	- Added workaround against annoying warning under Perl 5.6 in
	  Net::DNS module which is used by this module

0.16  Mon Sep 11 22:44:11 2000
	- Add another check: now module can verify user on SMTP servers
	  using combination of MAIL and RCPT commands. This check can detect
	  validness of mailboxes on more SMTP servers then VRFY check. By
	  default module now uses this new check. Old VRFY is still
	  supported but can be possibly removed in future becouse it seems
	  there is no need in it if we have MAIL/RCPT check (thanks for idea
	  to Marc Jauvin)
